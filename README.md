This git repository is simply a clone of my local documentations server that I use to manage the changes that happen to my local network system.  Everything here is a tad bit insane, and much of it is not something you would want to do on a production system.  However, for a network that is localized and not externally accessible it will do for handling what I need to get done.

Some pieces of my network will eventually be exposed to the internet (VPN, PLEX Media, ???) and those nodes will be individually secured as required and then port forwarded from the layer 1 NAT router.

This documentation is handled internally via a simple and lightweight documentation server called [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), it's also paired with another internally hosted image server [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/free).  These will both be documented at some point in time, but at the given moment they are [simply docker containers](https://github.com/Kiro47/Private_Documentation_Server) on my desktop until I move them to a dedicated server inside this project.  

This project is always moving and I intend to never really stop it, it's my own playground of sorts and an understanding to some of the things I do in my free time.
